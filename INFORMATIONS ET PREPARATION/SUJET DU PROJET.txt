Description:
Develop an app that will use the Movie Database API to search for TV Shows.
You will display the results of a query in a RecyclerView.
In a cell, some basic information will be displayed, such as the name of the TV
Show,and a thumbnail of the poster.
When a cell is clicked, another page is opened with more details, like the
number of seasons, number of episodes, list of actors.
When an actor is selected, a new page will be opened, with more details about
the actor.
