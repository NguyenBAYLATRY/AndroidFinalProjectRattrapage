Develop an app that will use the Movie Database API to search for TV Shows.
You will display the results of a query in a RecyclerView.
In a cell, some basic information will be displayed, such as the name of the TV
Show,and a thumbnail of the poster.
When a cell is clicked, another page is opened with more details, like the
number of seasons, number of episodes, list of actors.
When an actor is selected, a new page will be opened, with more details about
the actor.

- Import necessary libraries, such as a Network library and a Parsing library.
- Add mandatory permissions to your app from AndroidManifest.xml.
- Read Documentation from the Movie Database API.
- Create an account to get an API key.
- Implement a test request. (donâ€™t forget to add your API key).
- Create models to parse your data.
- Create a RecyclerView.
- Follow the exercise.
